# GFK_Forecasting
Forecaste the hourly booking of a taxi company

I have done the forecasting task using 3 different approaches
1. Using ARIMA model
2. Using Machine Learning Models (Gradient Boost and XG Boost)
3. Using Deep Learning (LSTM)

The models results can be found in 3 different jupyternotebooks. I have named the notebooks according the approaches I have used. You can run these notebooks if you face any libraries error please PIP install the libraries
